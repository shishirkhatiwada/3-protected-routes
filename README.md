# Frontend Challenge: Protecting Routes on the Client Side

This example demonstrates how to protect a route on the client side using React or Next.js. The `/special` route in this example will only be accessible to authorized users.

## Live Demo
[Protected Route App](https://3-protected-routes.vercel.app/login)

---

## Task Overview

- Implement a route guard for the `/special` page.
- Redirect unauthorized users to the login page or an error page.
- Authorized users will be allowed to access the `/special` route.

---

## How It Works

1. Use an authentication context or state to manage the user's authentication status.
2. Create a mechanism to check if the user is authenticated.
3. If the user is not authenticated, redirect them to a login page or display an error message.
4. If the user is authenticated, allow access to the `/special` route.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Framework for React-based applications.
- **React Context**: To manage global state (authentication).
- **React Router**: For handling client-side navigation.

## Deployment

1. Push the code to a GitHub repository.
2. Deploy the application on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or similar platforms.
3. Test the authentication and route protection.
